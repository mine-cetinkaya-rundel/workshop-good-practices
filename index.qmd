This is a brief resource for good practices for running workshops.
We collected these practices to serve as a quick guide for rstudio::conf workshop instructors, but they are good suggestions for any workshop, particularly those that involve computing.

Many of the ideas are borrowed from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/).
